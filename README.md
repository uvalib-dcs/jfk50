### Archived project *[KEEP!]*

live tweeting of UPI's Telex from Kennedy assassination 22-Nov 1963


+ [Announcement of the project](https://dcs.library.virginia.edu/2013/11/14/jfk50/)
+ [Digitized images of the Telex stream](https://static.lib.virginia.edu/JFK/)
+ [Virgo record MSS 15678](https://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/u6149386)
+ [Tracksys metadata MSS 15678](https://tracksys.lib.virginia.edu/admin/sirsi_metadata/16330)

It took me a while to find the images in Tracksys, and I don't see any sign of the text transcriptions there, so I suggest keeping these at least until those resources are tracked down and documented elsewhere. 

TeletypeForTweeting.csv contains the timestamps and text of the UPI wire service reports that were fed to Twitter API. ( The actual Ruby code to manage the feed is not as essential to permanently archive. )
