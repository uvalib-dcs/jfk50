UPR115	15:30	ON A BITTERLY COLD AND SNOWY DAY IN JANUARY, 1961, WHEN HE WAS INAUGURATED 35TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,
UPR115	15:30	JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY SOUNDED A CALL TO ACTION THAT IN MANY WAYS SUMMED UP HIS OWN REMARKABLE CAREER.
UPR115	15:30	"LET THE WORD GO FORTH FROM THIS TIME AND PLACE, TO FRIEND AND FOE ALIKE, HE SAID, "THAT THE TORCH HAS BEEN PASSED
UPR115	15:30	TO A NEW GENERATION OF AMERICANS --- BORN IN THIS CENTURY, TEMPERED BY WAR, DISCIPLINED BY A COLD AND BITTER PEACE."
UPR115	15:30	MR. KENNEDY WAS ALL THESE, AND HE BORE THE TORCH OF WORLD LEADERSHIP 
UPR115	15:30	IN A SOCIETY WHERE THE OLD ORDER WAS CHANGING FAST.
UPR115	15:30	ON THAT JANUARY DAY, NO MAN HAD EVER FLOWN IN SPACE.
UPR115	15:30	ON THAT DAY NEGROES IN SOUTHERN CITIES SUCH AS JACKSON AND BIRMINGHAM WERE NOT YET DEMONSTRATING. 
UPR115	15:30	ON THAT DAY THE WORLD HAD NOT COME CONSCIOUSLY CLOSE TO NUCLEAR DESTRUCTION AS IT DID IN THE GREAT CUBAN CRISIS OF 1962.
UPR115	15:30	"SURE IT'S A BIG JOB," MR. KENNEDY ONCE SAID. "BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY WHO CAN DO IT ANY BETTER THAN I CAN.
UPR115	15:30	I'M GOING TO BE IN IT FOR FOUR YEARS. IT ISN'T GOING TO BE SO BAD. 
UPR115	15:30	YOU'VE GOT TIME TO THINK --- AND BESIDES, THE PAY IS GOOD."
UPR115	15:30	HE LATER FOUND OUT -- AND CONCEDED -- THAT IT WAS A BIGGER JOB THAN HE ORIGINALLY BELIEVED. 
UPR115	15:30	BUT IT IS MOST UNLIKELY THAT HE EVER ONCE WAVERED IN THE BELIEF THAT NO ONE COULD HANDLE IT AS WELL AS HE COULD. 
UPR115	15:30	TO THINK OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN A NEGATION OF HIS WHOLE LIFE.
UPR115	15:30	THE PRESIDENCY OF JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY WAS BORN IN THE FIERCE PRIDE OF AN IRISH IMMIGRANT FAMILY. 
UPR115	15:30	IT WAS CAREFULLY NURTURED IN THE TRAINING STAGES BY A MULTI-MILLIONAIRE FATHER ... 
UPR115	15:30	AND BROUGHT TO FRUITION BY THE MAN HIMSELF THROUGH A DISTINGUISHED CAREER IN THE HOUSE 
UPR115	15:30	AND SENATE AND ON THE TRICKY CAMPAIGN TRAILS OF AMERICA.
